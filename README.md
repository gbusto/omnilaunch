# Omnilaunch

> **AI workflows that just work.**
> Run, train, benchmark, and reproduce *any* AI workflow on GPUs — cleanly, consistently, and reproducibly.

Omnilaunch is a **Python CLI** for building, deploying, and running GPU-powered AI workflows on [Modal](https://modal.com). It wraps the Modal API and CLI with a lightweight layer that standardizes how AI experiments, training runs, and benchmarks are executed — no custom infra, no guesswork.

At its core, Omnilaunch turns complex infrastructure into a simple, repeatable pattern:

```bash
omni build  → package a runner (creates versioned tarball + hash)
omni setup  → deploy to Modal and perform setup tasks (build image, download weights, run checks)
omni run    → execute an entrypoint on Modal (train, infer, benchmark, etc.)
```

Everything runs **on Modal** (where GPUs live) but can be **triggered from anywhere** using the CLI. And Hugging Face datasets, models, and libraries are a huge help in making it easy to build reliable, simple runners quickly.

The goal: **no broken Colabs, no dependency hell, no “it worked on my machine” — just reproducible AI workflows that work.**

## ⚡ Quick Start

Follow the [Modal account setup](./docs/MODAL_SETUP.md) guide first, then run this quickstart.
Setup takes ~2 minutes — no credit card required (Modal gives you $30/mo of free GPU time).

```bash
# 0. Setup
git clone https://github.com/gbusto/omnilaunch
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 1. Install
pip install -e omnilaunch/

# 2. Authenticate with Modal
modal setup

# 3. Check environment
omni doctor

# 4. Build a runner
omni build omnilaunch/registry/sdxl/

# 5. Deploy and download model weights (first-time setup)
omni setup omnilaunch/sdxl:0.1.0

# 6. Run inference
omni run omnilaunch/sdxl:0.1.0 infer \
  -p prompt="astronaut riding a horse on mars" \
  -p steps=25 \
  --save --outfile astronaut.png

# ✨ Image saved to ./omni_out/astronaut.png
```

**That’s it.** It just works — reproducibly, every time.

**Tip:** Use `--help` to explore any runner:

```bash
omni run omnilaunch/sdxl:0.1.0 --help       # List all entrypoints
omni run omnilaunch/sdxl:0.1.0 infer --help # Show parameters for infer
```

---

## 🧠 What Problem It Solves

Running open-source AI models today often means juggling fragile Colab notebooks, inconsistent repos, or expensive hosted endpoints.
Each model introduces new dependencies, system conflicts, and setup drift — and reproducibility breaks down almost immediately.

Omnilaunch fixes this by providing a **repeatable, transparent, versioned** way to build and execute GPU workloads.

* **Deterministic builds:** Modal images are immutable once built.
* **Versioned workflows:** Every runner build gets a unique hash and tarball.
* **Zero boilerplate:** Define a single `modal_app.py` and config — Omnilaunch handles the rest.
* **Portable results:** If it runs once, it’ll run again — reproducibly, anywhere Modal runs.

## 💡 Origin Story

Omnilaunch was born out of frustration while building [Blocksmith AI](https://blocksmithai.com), where I tested and fine-tuned dozens of models (SDXL, SD3.5, Hunyuan3D, Qwen-Image-Edit, MV-Adapter, and more) across platforms like Modal, Replicate, Fal, and Fireworks.ai. Each platform had its quirks: cryptic errors, training limits, hidden costs, and none of them had "the whole package" that could do everything I wanted with pricing that made sense for me.

At first, I relied on hosted platforms like Replicate, Fal, and Fireworks because they made model training and deployment look simple. But when I finally tried running everything myself on Modal, I realized it wasn’t hard at all! And it was faster, cheaper, and fully under my control.
AI (Claude Opus 4) helped me write the first working Modal script for SDXL fine-tuning, and it worked almost immediately. That was the breakthrough: I didn’t need to rely on hosted services. I could build my own reproducible workflows (and learn)!

So I turned that pattern of `build → setup → run` into a framework that made it easy for anyone to do the same. That became Omnilaunch: a tool for running any AI workflow (training, inference, benchmarking, or research replication) that just works.

## 🧩 What Omnilaunch Does

Omnilaunch provides a lightweight, opinionated framework for defining **reproducible AI workflows** — from quick tests to full-scale training pipelines.

You can:

* 🧠 **Prototype fast:** Run a single model or test a new LoRA without setup headaches.
* ⚙️ **Reproduce experiments:** Capture exact code, weights, and dependencies for consistent results.
* 🧪 **Benchmark at scale:** Standardize evaluation across many models or tasks.
* 🎓 **Teach or share workflows:** Package multi-stage examples (e.g., pretrain → RL → alignment → chat) as reusable runners.
* 🚀 **Recreate production jobs:** Launch the same workflows used in papers or production systems — deterministically.

It’s flexible enough for small experiments and robust enough for large-scale research reproduction.

## 🧩 What You Can Do Today

### 💬 **LLM Inference with Reasoning**
Run OpenAI's GPT-OSS models with parsed reasoning channels:

```bash
# 20B model on A10G
omni run omnilaunch/gpt-oss-20b:0.1.0 infer \
  -p messages='[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum entanglement"}]' \
  -p reasoning_level=high \
  --save --outfile response.json

# 120B model on H100
omni run omnilaunch/gpt-oss-120b:0.1.0 infer \
  -p messages='[{"role": "user", "content": "Prove the Pythagorean theorem"}]' \
  -p reasoning_level=high \
  -p max_tokens=1024 \
  --save

# Benchmark on tinyMMLU (60% accuracy on 10 samples, ~$0.12)
omni run omnilaunch/gpt-oss-20b:0.1.0 benchmark_tinymmlu \
  -p max_items=10 \
  -p reasoning_level=low \
  --save --outfile benchmark.json
```

Returns structured JSON with `response`, `analysis` (internal reasoning), and `commentary` (meta-observations). Benchmarking returns accuracy metrics, per-subject breakdown, and sample predictions.

omni run omnilaunch/qwen3-vl:0.1.0 train_lora \
  -p dataset_uri="unsloth/LaTeX_OCR" \
  -p epochs=1 \
  -p max_train_samples=200 \
  --save --outfile training_results.json

# Inference with your trained LoRA
omni run omnilaunch/qwen3-vl:0.1.0 infer \
  -p image="handwritten_math.png" \
  -p prompt="Convert this to LaTeX" \
  -p lora_run="brave-lion-1234" \
  --save --outfile output.json

# Pre-cache datasets on CPU (free!)
omni run omnilaunch/qwen3-vl:0.1.0 download_dataset \
  -p dataset_uri="unsloth/LaTeX_OCR"
```

LoRA adapters are saved with human-readable names (e.g., "brave-lion-1234") to `/omnilaunch/runs/qwen3-vl/`. Supports WandB integration for tracking metrics.

### 🔬 **Benchmarking**
Evaluate models on standard datasets:

```bash
# GPT-OSS-20B on tinyMMLU (100 samples, ~65 min, ~$1.19)
omni run omnilaunch/gpt-oss-20b:0.1.0 benchmark_tinymmlu \
  -p max_items=100 \

## ⚙️ How It Works

Each workflow is packaged as a **runner** — a directory with Python code and metadata describing how to execute a particular AI process.

### Runner Structure

```bash
omnilaunch/registry/sdxl/
├── modal_app.py       # Defines modal.Functions and entrypoints (train, infer, benchmark, etc.)
├── runner.yaml        # Metadata: name, version, GPU per entrypoint
├── schema/
│   ├── infer.json     # JSON schema for inference params
│   └── dataset.json   # JSON schema for training data
├── tests/smoke.py     # Basic smoke tests
└── README.md          # Workflow card with usage examples
```

Each runner can contain *any code* that can be written in Python and benefits from execution on a GPU. Common use cases:

* Model training (LLM, diffusion, RLHF, etc.)
* LoRA or fine-tuning workflows
* Evaluation and benchmarking scripts
* Multi-phase experiments or educational demos

**Runners can represent:**
- Official model deployments (e.g., Stability AI's SDXL)
- Optimized inference stacks (e.g., vLLM for LLMs, optimized diffusion pipelines)
- SaaS-ready backends (e.g., PhotoAI-style personalized image generation)
- Benchmarking setups (e.g., `omnilaunch/gpt-oss-20b` with `benchmark_tinymmlu` entrypoint)
- Educational tools (e.g., compare pre-alignment vs post-alignment LLM checkpoints)

### CLI Flow

| Command      | What it does                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `omni build` | Packages a runner directory into a versioned tarball and computes a hash. May later support signing for provenance.      |
| `omni setup` | Deploys the Modal app (builds Docker image, downloads weights, verifies environment). One-time setup per runner version. |
| `omni run`   | Invokes an entrypoint (train, infer, benchmark, etc.) on Modal's GPUs. Supports parameters and output saving.            |

### Entrypoints

Each runner defines standardized entrypoints. CPU and GPU resources are specified per-entrypoint:

```yaml
entrypoints:
  download_files:
    function: modal_app.py::download_files
    gpu: null  # CPU-only, ultra-cheap
  setup:
    function: modal_app.py::setup
    gpu: null  # CPU verification
  infer:
    function: modal_app.py::infer
    gpu: "A10G"  # GPU inference
    schema: schema/infer.json
  train_lora:
    function: modal_app.py::train_lora
    gpu: "A100"
    schema: schema/train_lora.json
```

**Everything is just:** `omni run <runner> <entrypoint>`

### Reproducibility

Every runner build creates:
- **Versioned tarball** — `runner.tar.gz` with all code and configs
- **Manifest hash** — Unique identifier for the exact runner version
- **Pinned dependencies** — Immutable Modal images with locked package versions

Coming soon:
- **Signed manifests** — Cryptographically verified with Sigstore/GPG
- **Run provenance** — Full audit trail from data → model → results

**Key features:**
- **Versioned** — `omnilaunch/sdxl:0.1.0`, `omnilaunch/sdxl:0.2.0`
- **Bundled** — Packaged as `.tar.gz` with manifest and schemas
- **Signed** *(coming)* — Cryptographically verified with Sigstore/GPG
- **Backend-agnostic** *(future)* — Modal first, then AWS/RunPod/local via IaC tools

---

## 🚧 Current Limitations

* 🧩 Runs **only on Modal** for now (multi-backend support is possible with IaC tooling).
* 🌐 No web UI yet (planned registry + metrics portal, like Docker Hub for AI workflows).

---

## 🔮 Future Vision

* **Public registry of verified runners:** Browse, version, and reproduce any workflow.
* **Provenance tracking & signing:** Each runner hash verifiable via Sigstore or similar.
* **Community templates:** Easy scaffolds for HF, PyTorch, or custom training setups.
* **Web interface:** Launch workflows, view logs, track metrics, and share results.
* **Automated runner generation:** LLMs that extend the registry automatically.

## 🎯 Core Use Cases

### 🧠 **Research & Replication**
Reproduce any paper with one command:
```bash
# Paper authors package their experiment as a runner
omni run omnilaunch/llama3-alignment-paper:0.1.0 train_full \
  --dataset hf:openmath/gsm8k@rev

# Benchmark results included
omni run omnilaunch/llama3-alignment-paper:0.1.0 eval_mmlu
omni run omnilaunch/llama3-alignment-paper:0.1.0 eval_gsm8k
```

Share *executable* results, not just papers. Encapsulate the entire experimental setup in a runner — training, evaluation, benchmarks. Full provenance from data → model → results.

### 🎓 **Education & Model Exploration**
Understand model evolution through training and alignment:

```bash
# Compare checkpoints at different training stages
omni run omnilaunch/llama3-checkpoints:0.1.0 infer \
  -p checkpoint="100k_steps" \
  -p prompt="Explain photosynthesis" \
  --save --outfile step_100k.json

omni run omnilaunch/llama3-checkpoints:0.1.0 infer \
  -p checkpoint="500k_steps" \
  -p prompt="Explain photosynthesis" \
  --save --outfile step_500k.json

omni run omnilaunch/llama3-checkpoints:0.1.0 infer \
  -p checkpoint="final" \
  -p prompt="Explain photosynthesis" \
  --save --outfile final.json

# See how responses improve with training

# Compare pre- and post-alignment behavior
omni run omnilaunch/llama3-base:0.1.0 infer \
  -p prompt="How do I build a bomb?" \
  --save --outfile pre_safety.json

omni run omnilaunch/llama3-safety-aligned:0.1.0 infer \
  -p prompt="How do I build a bomb?" \
  --save --outfile post_safety.json

# See how safety training affects responses
```

Interactive learning about training phases, RLHF, alignment, and safety interventions.

### 🚀 **SaaS Prototyping**
Omnilaunch standardizes **execution**, not hosting. Use runners as backends for your apps:

```bash
# Your backend uses the runner
omni run omnilaunch/sdxl-dreambooth:0.1.0 train_lora \
  --dataset hf:user/photos \
  --subject "sks person"

# Wrap with your UI, payment, and database
# → PhotoAI-style personalized generation
```

Go from idea to product in hours, not months.

### 🔬 **Benchmarking**
Model-specific, reproducible evaluation:

```bash
# Available now: tinyMMLU for GPT-OSS models
omni run omnilaunch/gpt-oss-20b:0.1.0 benchmark_tinymmlu \
  -p max_items=100 \
  --save --outfile results.json

# Coming soon: more benchmarks
omni run omnilaunch/gpt-oss-20b:0.1.0 benchmark_gsm8k
omni run omnilaunch/gpt-oss-20b:0.1.0 benchmark_humaneval
omni run omnilaunch/diffusion-bench:0.1.0 fid --dataset coco

# → Signed results feed reproducible leaderboards
```

Each benchmark includes full provenance: model version, dataset version, parameters, and hardware specs. Verifiable, reproducible results.

### 🔏 **Compliance & Governance**
