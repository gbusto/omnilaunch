# Modal Instructions

This is meant to be a full (and quick walkthrough) for setting your Modal account. Fortunately for us, they made it super easy!

If you already have a Modal account, then you can skip this whole thing.

It's pretty intuitive, but I wanted to provide a walkthrough with screenshots as a reference to make sure people don't get stuck.

## Step 1

Go to [Modal.com](https://modal.com) to start, then click the Sign Up button at the top right corner.
